# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

In this project, the data includes:
-lyrics.RData: Includes information on song titles, artists, genres, and lyrics
-artists.csv: Includes information on artists (not used in this analysis)
