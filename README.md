### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Project title: Patriotism and Protest
+ This project is conducted by Michael Petkun

+ Project summary: Like artists in most fields, songwriters often use their platforms to express political views. In this analysis, I evaluate sentiment within song lyrics to answer several related questions:
  + What types of patriotic and political words do songwriters feel positively or negatively about?
  + Do different genres express different political views?
  + Which genres are most likely to get political?

+ Main findings:
  + Songwriters tend to speak positively about patriotic terms (America, American, and USA) but negatively about political terms (American political parties and presidents)
  + Country, pop, and jazz music tend to be the most patriotic (speaking most positively about these terms), while electronic and indie music tend to be the most critical (speaking most negatively)
  + Hip hop music is the most political genre, mentioning these topics at a higher rate than other genres
